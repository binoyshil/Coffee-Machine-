# â˜• Coffee Machine Program

A simple **Coffee Machine Simulation** built in Python. The program allows users to choose from three types of coffee (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino), make a payment, and deduct the ingredients from available resources. It also includes reporting of the available resources and profits.

## Features
- Choose from three types of coffee: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino
- Check available resources and profits
- Make a payment using coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
- Automatically deduct ingredients from the stock based on the selected drink
- Handles insufficient resources and invalid payments

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Choose your drink by entering `espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino`.
3. Insert coins when prompted.
4. The program will check if there are sufficient resources for your selected drink.
5. If the payment is sufficient and resources are available, your drink will be made!
6. You can type `report` to check the remaining resources and the total profit.
